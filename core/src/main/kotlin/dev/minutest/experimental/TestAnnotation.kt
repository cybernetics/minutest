 * An experimental feature that allows contexts and tests to be annotated in order to change their execution.

 * [F] is the type of the fixture of the [Node] that the annotation applies to.

 * An annotation may have a [transform] - if so the transform is applied to the annotated node before tests are run.
 *
 * An annotation may have a [rootTransform] - if so the rootTransform is applied to root of the node tree before
 * tests are run.

    // a NodeTransform, which is just passed back here, so is safe?
